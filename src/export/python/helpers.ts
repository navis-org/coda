 * that has quietly stopped agreeing with the TypeScript it was ported from is worse than no
 * helper at all, because the notebook still runs and still answers.
 *
 * `caveHelpers.ts` is the same thing for the other backend, kept apart because it mirrors
 * `src/data/cave` and `src/data/annotations` rather than `src/nodes/lib` — and because a

/**
 * neuprint-python's `bodyId` → Coda's `neuronId`.
 *
 * The counterpart of R's `coda_neurons`, and it exists for the same reason one seam over:
 * **Coda calls the id column `neuronId` on every source**, because it is the one column every
 * node addresses by name and so the one that has to be Coda's vocabulary rather than a
 * backend's. neuprint-python publishes `bodyId`, which is neuPrint's property name.
 *
 * Every frame that comes back from `fetch_neurons` goes through this, or the next cell — a
 * Filter, a Group By, anything carrying a column param — addresses `neuronId` on a frame that
 * has no such column and raises a `KeyError` a long way from the cause.
 *
 * Note the asymmetry that makes this readable rather than confusing: the *argument* stays
 * neuPrint's, so a call reads `NeuronCriteria(bodyId=df['neuronId'].tolist())`. Coda's column
 * goes in, neuPrint's parameter takes it.
 *
 * Left alone when the frame already carries `neuronId`, so a table from an upload or an
 * aliased Cypher query passes through untouched.
